Visualize rectangular .jpg images and overlay .png files, with the same resolution, to change aspects of the visualization on the fly.

1. The main file should be [ANAME].jpg;
2. The "sprite" files should start with the main file name, the object name, and then the object characteristic: [ANAME]\_[OBJECT]\_[COLOR].png;

See below an example of this pattern:

By following this hierarchy we are able to see a menu like this after loading the files:
